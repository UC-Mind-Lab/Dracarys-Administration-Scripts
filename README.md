# Administration Scripts
These scripts are found to be useful in maintain "Dracarys",
a particular computer within the Mind Lab Research Group.
Note that they are meant to be "installed" with the Makefile.
The installed systemd timers will not be activated upon "installation",
and must be activated manually.
